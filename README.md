Searching for wallets works correctly

Product pages display correct details

Related best seller products are shown in the same category and price range

All scenarios (positive, negative, edge cases) are covered

 Technology & Framework
Testing Framework: Playwright

Language: TypeScript

Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)

Reporting: Playwright HTML Report

Test Coverage
Positive test cases: Search, product details, related products, mobile/tablet responsiveness, performance

Negative test cases: Invalid/empty/special character/long search, network interruption, missing related products, invalid URL, JavaScript disabled

Edge cases: High/low price products, page refresh, multiple rapid clicks, session maintenance

 Features
Page Object Model (POM): Clean separation of test logic and UI locators.

Robust locators: Updated for eBay's June 2025 UI.

Parallel execution: Runs tests in parallel for speed.

Comprehensive reporting: HTML, JSON, and JUnit reports.



Code Example
typescript
// Example test case
test('Should navigate to first wallet product', async () => {
  await homePage.navigateTo(config.baseUrl);
  await homePage.searchFor('wallet', 'All Categories');
  await searchPage.clickFirstResult();
  expect(await productPage.getProductTitle()).toBeTruthy();
});
